# Phase 0 of CPSC 210 Project

## The Proposal
My project will be an **"Shop Inventory/Management"** application. The application allows a user to be in charge of and manage the inventory of their own shop. Possible features include the following:
- Adding items to the shop to be purchased
- Categorizing/defining specific qualities for each added item 
    - Possible categories include what type of item is it (e.g. is it a type of armor, a type of consumable, etc.), the rarity or quality of the item, the price of the item, and a general description of the item
- Filtering for a list of specific types of items available in the shop
- Selling items in the shop
    - Tracking the total money earned from selling items
- Applying a sale or discount to an item(s) in the shop
- Creating, saving, and/or loading a new shop

The application can be used personally for an individual to keep track of and manage items they may want to sell to others. Alternatively, the application could be used for more creative/game-like purposes, such as for individuals who want a way to manage a fictional shop in a role-playing game they may be running with friends.

This project is of interest because while the thematic of the project is fun to me, I find the application also has the potential to test my understanding of several core elements of coding (creating and manipulating objects, usage of Arrays, etc.) in a way that will not only improve my understanding of coding but ultimately leave me with an application that my friends and I could utilize for our own recreational use.
